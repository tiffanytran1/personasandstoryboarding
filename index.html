    <h3> Most dorms at Brown <span class="blue-text">lack accessible and easy-to-use water bottle refilling stations</span>. 
      Of those that do exist, most are difficult to use and not standardized across campus.
    </h3>

    <h4>Therefore, <span class="blue-text">to best understand the problem</span>, students who live on campus were interviewed. 
      The <span class="blue-text">Qs</span> and summarized <span class="blue-text">As</span> are below!

    <!-- <h4>Let's examine the <span class="purple-text"><u>inputs</u></span> and <span class="orange-text"><u>outputs</u></span> of three applications commonly used by Brown CS students
    </h4> -->
    <!-- <p><span class="purple-text">Here are the questions I asked:</span>
    </p> -->
    <p> <span class="purple-text">1. How do you usually get drinking water?</span></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;"> dorm water station, Britas, dining halls, or academic buildings</p>

    <p> <span class="purple-text">2. What influences your choice of where to fill your water bottle?</span></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;"> convenience (distance and ease of use), cleanliness in / around filter, and water taste  </p>

    <p> <span class="purple-text">3. Have you used the bottle refill stations in your dorm? If so, please describe the experience?</span></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;"> depending on station type, either very convenient and efficient or distrust in them entirely</p>
    
    <p> <span class="purple-text">4. What do you think about the taste, convenience, and reliability of this option?</span></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">  convenience is huge plus, but major concerns with filter maintenance, location inconvenience</p>

    <p> <span class="purple-text">5. If your dorm lacks a refill station or filtered dispenser, how do you manage?</span></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;"> rely on Britas, external sources, or wait until very thirsty then use dorm station</p>

    <p> <span class="purple-text">6. Have you faced any challenges in getting clean drinking water? If so, what were they?</span></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">outdated filters, distant (3+ floors of stairs) refill stations, extreme dirtiness around filters </p>

    <p> <span class="purple-text">7. Has your experience with dorm water access met your expectations? Why or why not?</span></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">users who live in newer dorms satisfied, everyone else extremely disapointed </p>

    <p> <span class="purple-text">8. If you could improve aspects of water access accross campus, what would they be?</span></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 40px;">multiple refill stations in dorms and increased accessibility    </p>


  <h5>Overall Takeaways</h5>

    <div id="cabGallery">
      <h4><span class="blue-text">Most students find dorm water stations unsatisfactory and want cleaner, newer, and more accessible options.</span></h4>
      <h4><span class="blue-text">Some water filling stations are hard to use and very inconveniently located.</span></h4>
      <h4><span class="blue-text">Students' experience with dorm water stations depends heaviliy on how old their dorm is and when it was last renovated.</span></h4>
    </div> 

    <h4>From these interviews, I constructed <span class="blue-text"> two personas</span> that represent archetypal characters, each reflecting a segment of the user spectrum I observed.
    </h4>
   


    <h5><span class="purple-text"><u>1. Happy Henry</span></u></h5>
    <p style="padding-right: 12%;"> Henry is a freshman, who lives in one of the nicer dorms on campus. He lives on the same floor as a clean water botter refilling station, so he is never walking around campus thirsty. 
      Happy Henry represents about half of the student population, those who live in newer dorms with easy access to clean water and are very happy with that proximity.</p>

    <h5><span class="orange-text"><u>2. Nonplussed Natali</span></u></h5>
    <p style="padding-right: 12%;"> Nonplussed Natali represents the other half of the student population who has to go to extreme lengths (5+ flights of stairs or the
       nearest academic building) get clean drinking water. Most times, the sink that houses the water faucet is left extremely dirty by the other students living in her dorm
       she is unable to use that faucet. This experience leaves her very disapointed and dismayed with her living situation.</p>

    <h4> Let's dive deeper into Nonplussed Natali and see how she would get water if her bottle was empty!

        <p style="padding-left: 4%; font-size: 10pt;"> Berudgingly, Nonplussed Natali makes the brave decision to walk to her dorm's water bottle refilling station, which is located down 5 flights of stairs.  </p>

        <img class="csImage" src="./assets/s3.jpg" />
